# Project Captone: Supervised Learning
## Building a Diabetes Detection System

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is recommended that you install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Code has been created in the notebook `diabetes_detection.ipynb` 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `capstone_project/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook diabetes_detection.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook diabetes_detection.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `diabetes.csv`. This dataset has the following attributes:

- `pregnancies` : Number of times pregnant
- `glucose` : Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `blood_pressure` : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `skin_thickness` : Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `insulin` : 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `bmi` : Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `diabetes_pedigree_function` : Diabetes pedigree function
- `age` : Age (years)
- `outcome` : Class variable (0 or 1)
